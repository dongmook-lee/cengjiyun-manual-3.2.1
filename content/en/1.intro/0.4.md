title: "Pipeline Layer"

---

The pipeline layer automates container building and deployment from code.

The build step performed tasks \(code download, build/test\) and container image building sequentially based on user settings. Tasks use containers that perform tasks internally and can be scaled using public or user-created containers in addition to the default containers.

Built images are updated (rolling) to containers on a Cocktail server. Images created in the build step are assigned an automatic build number, which is used for version updates or rollbacks.

All work processes from build to deployment are automated via the pipeline. Thus, developers can focus on writing and modifying code once a pipeline is configured.

The following diagram shows how the pipeline layer is structured:

The pipeline layer provides a foundation for DevOps through continuous integration and deployment \(CI/CD\), and DevOps emphasizes continuity and organic cooperation between development and operations. As one of the components required for DevOps, CI/CD is equally important in container-based development and operations.
